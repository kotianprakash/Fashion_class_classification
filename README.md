# Fashion Class Classification Using CNN
Introduction
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of fashion items into different classes. The idea is to train a model that can accurately classify images of clothing and accessories based on their visual features.





-The program will load the fashion dataset and split it into training and testing sets.

-The program will then train a CNN model on the training set.
After training, the program will evaluate the performance of the model on the testing set.

The program will display the accuracy and loss values for the model.

The program will also display a few sample images from the testing set along with their predicted classes.
Algorithm

The algorithm used to classify fashion items into different classes is based on CNNs. Here's how it works:

The program reads in images of fashion items from the fashion dataset.

The program applies various image processing techniques to enhance the features of the images.

The program trains a CNN model on the training set to learn the features of different fashion items.

The program evaluates the performance of the model on the testing set by comparing its predictions with the true labels of the images.

The program uses the trained model to predict the classes of sample images from the testing set.

# Conclusion
Fashion class classification using CNNs is a powerful technique for automatically classifying images of clothing and accessories. This project demonstrates how CNNs can be used to learn the features of different fashion items and accurately classify them into different classes. With further development and refinement, this technique could be used in real-world applications such as online shopping or fashion recommendation systems.
